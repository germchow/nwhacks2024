# FarmShare

## Inspiration

- In the quest for innovative solutions at our hackathon, we draw inspiration from the challenging economic landscape and the staggering issue of over 2.5 billion tons of food wastage. Motivated by the desire to address these pressing concerns, our team envisions the development of a platform that serves as a vital link between farmers and individuals facing financial hardships. 

- Specifically, we aim to connect farmers' surplus produce, often deemed "ugly" but still perfectly edible, with those in need, thereby fostering a sustainable and compassionate approach to reducing food waste while assisting those struggling to make ends meet.

## What it does

- Our platform, FarmShare, is a web application that allows farmers to post their surplus produce for sale at a discounted price. Individuals facing financial hardships can then purchase these items at a reduced cost.

## How we built it

- Leveraging a tech stack that included React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we meticulously constructed our platform to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Challenges we ran into

- The project presented ambitious goals, driven by a desire to address the significant issue of food waste. However, the expansive scope, coupled with time constraints, posed challenges in fully implementing all our envisioned features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Our proudest achievement lies in the creation of an application that directly contributes to reducing the staggering 2.5 billion tons of food waste. Additionally, we take pride in the fact that our platform extends its impact by assisting families facing financial difficulties in providing nutritious meals for their loved ones.

## What we learned

- Throughout this project, our team embarked on a dynamic learning journey, acquiring proficiency in React and Figma to craft an interactive and visually compelling platform. However, the most impactful lessons stemmed from our newfound awareness of the substantial food waste generated by farmers, exacerbated by the limited market for unconventionally shaped or sized produce. 

- This revelation underscored the challenges faced by farmers and the hesitancy of grocery stores to purchase such items. This awareness has not only broadened our technical skill set but has also deepened our commitment to addressing these issues and creating innovative solutions that contribute to more sustainable and equitable food systems.

## What's next for FarmShare

- Looking ahead, we plan to refine and expand FarmShare by incorporating user feedback and addressing any identified shortcomings. Additionally, we aspire to explore partnerships and scale the platform to reach a wider audience, ensuring its sustained impact on both reducing food waste and supporting vulnerable families.

- In addition, we would need to implement the usage of a real database, as well as login functionality and authentication in order for farmers and users to create accounts and match with each other.
